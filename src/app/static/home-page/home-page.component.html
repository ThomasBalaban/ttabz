  <p>I am a Pittsburgh based Web Developer with over 7 years of professional experience in a wide range of disciplines. You can always find me teaching people how to make their passion projects from start to finish using a lesson plan of my own design. Ask about it! I spend the rest of my time self-learning - currently learning more in-depth software engineering principles with Angular 2+ and C#. Find me at one of Pittsburgh's unique bars or on discord finding the perfect gif to send to my peers!</p>

  <h3>The Beginning</h3>
  <p>My journey into web development started at the young age of 9 when I was getting really involved in the gaming scene. Avid player of the oldies but goodies like Runescape and Yugioh I soon found myself involved in clans and sites thats often needed updates and/or improvements. I quickly became obsessed with Adobe Photoshop and moved from there to Freewebs and Geocities, have you heard of these? I started making sites or providing updates for my crew and various other small but unique organizations such as Alter Reality Games. By the time I reached High School I was very aware this is what I loved doing and could see myself commiting to the journey of a developer.</p>
  <p>I attending Pittsburgh Technical College and studied under <a href="http://www.joshuasager.com/" target="_blank">Josh Sager</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/frank-schurter-38659b22/" target="_blank">Frank Schurter</a>. During my time there I became a teachers assistant due to my previous experience and teaching nature! I always enjoyed helping lead others to their path of success, and helping and tutoring was a great real world experience to help me learn how to become better at that along with learning tons myself! You would be surprised what kind of bugs can come out of the same small project from different points of view.</p>
